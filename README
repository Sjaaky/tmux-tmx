A tmux initialization script that opens up a tmux with a special
.tmux.conf file depending on the type of connection:

    1. .tmux.conf: standard 
    2. .tmux.conf.nested: nested tmux session
    3. .tmux.conf.mini: small resolution screen version

Launch the script with 

    tmx $session_name
    # $session_name is any name for the default session
    # $session_name can be "-d" which is default and names the session after the HOST
    
It is recommended that you call this as soon as you open the shell, so
put this at the end your .bashrc (linux) or .bash_profile (OS X) file

     if [[ ! -n $TMUX ]] && [[ "$COMP_TYPE" != "central" ]] && [[ ! -n $SSH_CONNECTION ]] ; then
        # This checks if tmux exists, and if it does, runs the startup script tmx
        {  hash tmux 2>&- && tmx $(hostname -s) ; } || echo >&2 "tmux did not startup on this machine (is it installed?) ..." 
     fi
